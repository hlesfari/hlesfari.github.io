         <h2>About</h2>
         <p style="font-size:18px;">Since October 2019, I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at <a href="https://univ-cotedazur.eu/">Université Côte D'Azur</a>, under the guidance of
             <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Frederic.Giroire/">Frédéric Giroire</a>.</p>

         <p style="font-size:18px;"> I'm a member of <a href="https://team.inria.fr/coati/">COATI</a>, a
             joint project-team between <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-universite-cote-azur/">INRIA Sophia Antipolis Méditerranée</a> and the
             <a href="https://www.i3s.unice.fr/en/">I3S laboratory</a> of the <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/en">CNRS</a>.</p>

        <p style="font-size:18px;">My thesis lies at the intersection of graph representation learning and combinatorial network optimization.
            The aim is to understand how combining graph-based approaches with machine learning techniques can be leveraged to solve efficiently network optimization problems
            such as dynamic resource allocation and anomaly detection.</p>

        <p style="font-size:18px;">I have a broad range of interests in artificial intelligence that takes a broad view of the field and the many other areas
            it shapes and that in turn shapes it.
